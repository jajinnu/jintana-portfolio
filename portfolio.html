            <h2> Design process </h2>
            <h3>
              I excel in managing the entire design lifecycle, ensuring a comprehensive approach from initial ideation through to final testing. 
              My process begins with <b>ideation and research</b>, where I gather insights and define the project's goals using user-centered design principles. 
              I employ frameworks such as <b>MoSCoW prioritization</b> and <b>SMART goals</b> to organize and prioritize tasks, ensuring that every aspect of the project is addressed effectively.
            </h3>
            <h3>
              During the <b>wireframing</b> and <b>mockup</b> phases, I utilize Figma to create detailed wireframes and interactive prototypes. Figma allows me to develop and iterate on design concepts quickly, 
              facilitating collaboration and feedback from stakeholders. My focus is on ensuring a seamless user experience, balancing aesthetics with functionality to create intuitive and engaging digital products.
            </h3>
            <h3>
              In the <b>prototyping</b> phase, I develop interactive prototypes that simulate the final product's functionality. This stage is crucial for identifying potential issues and refining the user experience. 
              By conducting thorough <b>user testing</b>, I gather valuable feedback to iterate and improve the design, ensuring that the final product meets user needs and expectations.
            </h3>
            <h3>
              Throughout the process, I maintain a strong focus on <b>usability</b> and <b>visual design</b>, aiming to deliver solutions that are both effective and aesthetically pleasing.

              I have experience in designing immersive and interactive gameplay across various formats, including board games, 
              <b>2D game</b>, and <b>3D games</b>. My approach to game design is rooted in creating engaging gameplay mechanics, 
              level design, and user interactions that immerse players and provide a compelling experience.
            </h3>
            <h3>
              For <b>physical games</b>, I’ve designed and prototyped a board game using traditional materials like paper, which allowed me to focus on the tactile 
              and social elements of gameplay. This project honed my skills in balancing strategy, challenge, and player engagement, offering a hands-on understanding
               of game mechanics in non-digital formats.
            </h3>
            <h3>
              In the digital realm, I’ve developed <b>2D game</b> using <b>GameMaker Studio2</b>, where I design intricate levels and refine gameplay mechanics to ensure fluid, enjoyable experiences. 
              My <b>3D game design</b> work is developed in <b>Unity</b>, where I focus on building visually immersive worlds and interactive elements. Unity’s robust features allow me to experiment 
              with different mechanics, physics, and player dynamics, ensuring a polished and engaging final product.
            </h3>
            <h3>
              I apply <b>game design lenses</b> to critically analyze and improve each game, focusing on elements like player immersion, feedback loops, and balancing difficulty. 
              By understanding and applying game theory, I ensure that my designs are not only innovative but also deeply engaging for players.

            <h2>Prototyping </h2>
            <h3>
              Prototyping is a key part of my design workflow, allowing me to bring concepts to life and rapidly test and refine ideas. 
              I have extensive experience with both physical and digital prototyping methods, ensuring that each project evolves through iterative development, improving with every stage.
            </h3>
            <h3>
              I’m skilled in <b>3D printing</b> and experienced in <b>laser cutting</b>, which I use to create precise physical models. 
            For example, I’ve developed functional prototypes like a <b>3D-printed candle holder</b> and a <b>laser-cut word clock</b>, 
            enabling me to test form and functionality in real-world environments. These hands-on processes allow me to validate designs quickly, 
            identify potential improvements, and iterate toward a final product.
            </h3>
            <h3>
              For more interactive and dynamic prototypes, I utilize <b>Arduino</b> to build functional, movable prototypes. 
              In one project, I developed an <b>LED lamp</b> with customizable lighting features controlled by Arduino. 
              This type of prototyping allows me to experiment with electronics and interactivity, 
              adding another layer of functionality to my designs.
            </h3>
            <h3>
              Throughout the prototyping process, I emphasize <b>iterative design</b>, continually refining the product based on user feedback and testing results. 
              This ensures that the final outcome is not only functional but also optimized for usability and user experience. 
              By combining various technologies and prototyping methods, I can efficiently bring ideas from concept to tangible product, 
              ready for real-world testing and further development.

                <h2>Programming </h2>
                <h3>I have extensive experience in web development, particularly with HTML/CSS for building and maintaining websites. 
                    This includes the development of both the current and previous versions of this portfolio, where I focused on creating a clean,
                    responsive design that adapts across devices. In my academic coursework, I contributed to a platform for CitizenLab using PHP, 
                    with the goal of integrating social media APIs (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) to streamline communication and data collection 
                    for health-related user queries. This project required me to work collaboratively, ensuring that the platform met the needs of users 
                    while also integrating backend functionality to improve operational efficiency.
                </h3>
          
                <h3>In addition to web development, I have worked extensively with Arduino to create interactive installations. 
                    One notable project was the development of a word clock, where I programmed the Arduino to control dynamic displays and lighting effects. 
                    This project honed my skills in hardware integration and embedded programming, blending creative design with technical execution.
                </h3>

                <h3>I also have strong experience in Python programming, particularly in the field of machine learning. A standout project involved creating an AI-powered Pac-Man game, 
                    where I implemented an A search algorithm* to optimize the AI’s behavior and decision-making. We incorporated OpenCV to allow the game to recognize hand gestures via a camera, 
                    enabling users to control the game without a traditional input device. This project allowed me to combine my interest in artificial intelligence with practical, 
                    interactive applications, while also sharpening my skills in algorithm design and computer vision.
