            <h2>3D Design</h2>
            <h3>
                I specialize in creating immersive 3D models, environments, and interactive elements for game design, 
                product prototyping, and architectural visualization. My primary expertise lies in <b>Blender</b>, where 
                I excel in crafting detailed and high-quality visuals tailored to each project's needs. 
                While Blender is my main tool, I also have experience with <b>SketchUp</b> and <b>Maya</b> for specific tasks and <b>Fusion 360</b> for product design, 
                which has broadened my adaptability across different design tools and enhanced my ability to learn new technologies.
