    In this section, I explore the intersection of creativity and functionality through hands-on prototyping. 
    By integrating a variety of tools and techniques—from laser cutting and 3D printing to Arduino programming.
    I bring innovative ideas to life. These prototypes demonstrate my ability to iterate on designs, solve technical challenges, 
    and transform concepts into fully realized products.

            <h2>Word clock project</h2>
            <h3>Inspired by a word clock I saw at a friend's house, I decided to design my own version. 
                The process began with hand-drawn sketches and quickly progressed to a cardboard prototype, incorporating an <b>Arduino Nano</b> for real-time functionality. 
                I programmed the <b>LED lights</b> to update the time via an internet connection, integrating the system seamlessly with the house's network.
            <h3>To refine the design, I attended a laser-cutting workshop, using Inkscape to create the final design. With access to a design lab, 
                I transformed the concept into a polished, laser-cut model. Unlike traditional word clocks that display time in words (e.g., "quarter to five"), 
                I customized my version to show time numerically, improving readability while maintaining the original concept.</h3>     
            <center><h3><b>Watch the video </b>to see the clock in action!</h3></center>

            <h2>Candle Holder project</h2>
            <h3>For this project, I designed a distinctive candle holder inspired by the playful form of a hedgehog. 
                Using Blender, I crafted a detailed 3D model with a unique spiked texture and incorporated four sturdy legs for stability. 
                After finalizing the design, I 3D printed the holder and tested it with actual candles, 
                ensuring that the dimensions were precisely aligned for proper functionality.</h3>
            
            <h3>The combination of the spiked texture and the robust four-legged design highlights my attention to detail and
                 demonstrates my ability to translate 3D models into functional, real-world objects. This project not only showcases
                 my skills in creative design and practical implementation but also underscores my proficiency in both 3D modeling and physical prototyping.

                <p><b>Functional Features: </b> The four-legged base ensures the candle holder stands securely, demonstrating my focus on practical usability alongside creative aesthetics.</p>
                <p><b>Precise Execution:</b> After finalizing the Blender model, I 3D printed the holder and carefully measured the candle size to guarantee a perfect fit. 
                    This attention to detail ensures the prototype functions as intended in a real-world setting.</p>

            <h2>3D Lamp Installation</h2>
            <h3>For a high school assignment on "Everyday Objects," I created a unique LED lamp installation inspired by the TWIX bar—a snack I frequently encountered in the vending machine. 
                Opting for a 3D approach allowed me to explore the potential of transforming a familiar item into an interactive art piece.</h3>
                <h3>This project highlights my foundational skills in 3D modeling and functional art, 
                    demonstrating my enthusiasm for creating innovative and interactive design solutions.</h3>
            <div class="h7">
                <p><b>Concept & Design:</b>The installation features tubes representing the layers of a TWIX bar, symbolizing its distinct ingredients. 
                    I bent straight steel wire to form the structure, incorporating three tubes in between, each filled with beads to represent the colors and textures of the TWIX filling.</p>
                <p><b>Technical Execution: </b> LED wires were integrated into the design, providing functional lighting controlled by a switch. 
                    This demonstrated my ability to combine artistic vision with practical functionality, despite my developing technical skills at the time.</p>
                <p><b>Creative Exploration:</b> This project highlights my early interest in interactive installations and 3D design. 
                    It illustrates my capacity to merge creative concepts with practical elements, resulting in a visually engaging and innovative design solution.</p>
