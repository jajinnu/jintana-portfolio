<div class="h9">
    My expertise in game design spans across a range of styles, from physical board games to 2D and 3D digital environments. 
    I focus on designing immersive gameplay mechanics, detailed levels, and interactive experiences. With each project, 
    I aim to create structured, engaging games that blend creativity with innovative design elements. Below are some examples of the games I’ve developed.

            <h2>3D Interactive game</h2>
            <h3> 
                In this Unity-based 3D game, players control a bee navigating through an environment filled with challenges. 
                The objective is to collect honey and pollen while avoiding enemies (wasps) that detect the player's presence. 
                The game features custom-designed elements like flowers, chickens, and gardeners, which were modeled in Blender, 
                and ambient sound effects created in <b>Reaper</b> and connected in Unity with <b>FMOD</b> to enhance immersion.
            </h3>

            <h3>In the game, the objective is to escape enemies that detect the player’s presence when nearby (wrasp). The player must collected the honey and pollen to unlock the next level portal.
                Throughout the gameplay, the ambient sound, sound effects are self made, it interacted as the player did something for example pass through the portal, get near by the wrasp.   </h3>
            <div class="h7">
                <p><b>Sound:</b> I personally created the game's sound effects, which adapt to player actions, such as nearing enemies or passing through portals.</p>
                <p><b>Gameplay Mechanics:</b> I was responsible for programming the bee’s flight mechanics, life counting, and level progression. Players solve puzzles, evade enemies, and unlock new levels by reaching portals.</p>
                <p><b>Learning Experience:</b> As my third game project, this experience significantly advanced my skills in level design, character control, and event-based logic within Unity.</p>
                <p>The video contains the full image of how this Bee game works and the mechanic testing showed how I did the testing in a normal form first. It helps me to reduce time in awaiting for the final bee design.</p>

            <h2>2D Maze game</h2>
            <h3>During the summer of 2020, I created my first game, a 2D Maze Puzzle. This project marked my transition from playing games to developing them, 
                and it was a transformative learning experience. The game is centered around navigating a maze, avoiding enemies, and progressing through multiple levels.
            </h3>

            <h3>In the game, the objective is to escape enemies that detect the player’s presence when nearby. The player must reach the door at the end of each maze to advance to the next level. 
                Throughout the maze, there are cheese collectibles that players can gather, but these don't impact the outcome—the only way to win is by reaching the next level door.   </h3>
            <div class="h7">
                <p><b>Sprite Creation:</b> I personally designed and drew all the characters and objects in pixel art, which gives the game a distinct, retro-inspired visual style.</p>
                <p><b>Gameplay Mechanics:</b> Players navigate a maze, encountering various obstacles and solving puzzles to progress.</p>
                <p><b>Learning Experience:</b>As this was my first game, I learned the fundamentals of level design, character control, and event-based logic using GameMaker Studio 2. 
                    This project honed my skills in game design and coding, laying the foundation for future projects.</p>
