            <h2>Blender</h2>
            <h3>Blender, an open-source 3D modeling powerhouse, is my go-to tool for creating visually captivating and intricate models. With its robust feature set, 
                I push the boundaries of my creativity, turning abstract ideas into tangible, high-quality visuals. My Blender work reflects not only technical know-how 
                but also the power of storytelling through design. Here are some key projects I've completed using Blender:</h3>
                <div class="h7">
                    <p><b>Cartoon Vending Machine:</b> Designed a playful, cartoon-style vending machine, emphasizing creativity and vibrant aesthetics. 
                        This project showcases my ability to produce engaging and imaginative 3D visuals. (Image (1/3))</p>
                    <p><b>Directional Sign:</b>Developed for my thesis, featuring painted textures to illustrate two different paths—a straight route and a curved path surrounded by trees. 
                        This demonstrates my skills in texture painting and environmental modeling.(Image (2/3))</p>
                    <p><b>Character Design:</b> Created a character inspired by a cactus and eggs, with vivid colors and dynamic lighting. This project highlights my ability 
                        to craft unique and lively 3D characters, enhancing visual appeal and storytelling.(Image (3/3))</p>

                <h2>Maya</h2>
                  <h3>Autodesk Maya is my primary tool for more intricate 3D modeling and animation work. 
                    Its powerful features help me create highly detailed and immersive environments, 
                    making it an excellent choice for complex models and interactive applications.

                  <div class="h7">
                  <p><b>Arcade Machine:</b> In our M4 project, we developed an arcade machine to raise awareness about accepting cookies online. It starts off user-friendly, 
                    but as participants interact with the dance mat, the experience turns unsettling, revealing that by answering questions, they’ve given their consent—similar to online cookie practices. 
                    <p>I contributed by designing a 3D model of the machine using Maya, which helped visualize its placement in a room and finalize the layout before construction. 
                    The project was showcased at the Gogbot festival in Enschede, where the real installation (as seen in the image below) won an award for our innovative approach to privacy awareness.</p>

                  <p><b>Moon Landing Snow Globe: </b> I designed a snow globe with a detailed moon landing scene, including astronauts and a moon lander. 
                    The model, imported into Unity, reflects both detailed modeling and potential for interactive features. 
                    This project showcases my ability to combine creativity with technical precision in 3D environments.
